	In order to manage all the departmental activities it would be a good idea to 
	computerize a gross root level functionalities of Public Distribution System (PDS).
	In almost all villages we use to find fair price shops (FPS).The PDS is being 
	implemented through FPS only. Usually FPshops will be linked to civil supplies go 
	downs, sometimes one FPS is covering number of villages and some line. One village
	 can have more than one FPS. FPS usually maintains records about opening and 
	 closing balance of the stock of various commodities. FPS dealers usually lift the 
	 monthly allotment from civil supplies goes down after getting the permission 
	 from MRO. After lifting the stock they use to sell the stock to ration card 
	 holders as per the existing norms.
